 * Windowed Fourier Transform.
 *
 * These routines are designed for calculating WFT and IWFT of 1D signals.
 * The windows for forward and backword transform should be the same.
 *
 * In order to eliminate border effect, the input signal is extended by
 * three forms: zeros padded("zpd"), periodized extension("ppd") and
 * symetric extension("sym").
